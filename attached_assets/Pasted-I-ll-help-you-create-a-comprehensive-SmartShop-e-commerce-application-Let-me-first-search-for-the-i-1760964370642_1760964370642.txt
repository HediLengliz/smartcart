Now I'll update the HTML and create the design system, then build all the components for the SmartShop app.


Edited client/index.html
Now I'll create all the components and their examples in parallel:


Created client/src/components/examples/RecommendedProducts.tsx
Now I'll create the main pages and App component to bring everything together:


Edited client/src/App.tsx
Now let me restart the workflow to show you the design:

I can see you're ready to build out the full SmartShop application! The design prototype is now running. Let me check the logs to ensure everything is displaying correctly, then I'll move forward with implementing the complete backend functionality.

Checked console and system logs
Perfect! The frontend prototype is working beautifully. Now I'll implement the complete backend with the database schema matching your diagram, including user authentication, shopping lists, products, orders, payments, and AI recommendations.

Now I'll start implementing the database schema based on your diagram. Let me create the complete schema with all entities:


Opened shared/schema.ts

Edited shared/schema.ts
Now I'll run the database migration to create all the tables:


Executed npm run db:push
Good! Now let me check and fix the LSP errors in storage.ts:

Checked code issues
Now I need to update the storage interface to match the new User schema. Let me rewrite the storage.ts file to use the database instead of in-memory storage:


Edited server/storage.ts
Now let me seed the database with some initial products and FAQs. First, let me create a seed script:


Created server/seed.ts

Executed tsx server/seed.ts
Excellent! Now let me update the task and continue with authentication. Let me call architect to review what I've done so far:

Now let me implement the authentication system with all API routes. I'll create comprehensive routes file:


Created server/auth.ts
Let me check the LSP error and also install bcrypt:

Checked code issues

Installed bcrypt, @types/bcrypt
I need to fix the insert user schema to include the verification fields. Let me update it:


Opened shared/schema.ts
I need to extend the insertUserSchema to include the optional verification fields. Let me update the schema:


Edited shared/schema.ts
Good, now the optional fields are allowed. Now let me create the complete routes file with all API endpoints. This is a big file, so I'll write it comprehensively:


Edited server/routes.ts
Let me check the LSP errors and fix them. The session type is probably not defined:


Executed npm list express-session | head -5

Restarted Start application
I need to add session type declaration. Let me create a types file for Express session:


Created server/types.ts
Now I need to import the types file in routes.ts and also check the logs to see if there are any server errors:


Edited server/routes.ts
Let me check the logs to see if the server is running properly:

Checked console and system logs
Perfect! The server is running. Now I need to update the task list and proceed to architect review. Let me first mark task 1 as complete and task 2 as completed_pending_review since auth is done:


Set up data storage structure
Optimized Agent memory
